    Good morning. When you think of Southern Oregon, most people don't immediately think of technology leadership. But I'm here to tell you that we have <strong>world-class innovators</strong> among us. You can often find them working at White Rabbit — which from the outside looks like a caf&eacute;. But <strong>it's actually a lab.</strong>

    We launched last September after spending years building a community of builders through the <strong>Rogue Valley AI Lab</strong>, which we started here in Ashland going on three years ago. We focus on launching real AI-powered businesses. Our caf&eacute; has become a perfect test case for where business is headed.

    How many of you have used an AI chatbot, like ChatGPT? <span class="action">[Click.]</span> Chances are you use it as a tool. A very handy tool — you ask a question, it gives an answer, waits for another one. Let's contrast that with <strong>AI as a teammate</strong> — what we call "agentic AI." This is AI that can be given a goal and tools, and it figures out on its own how to reach that goal. It perceives the world around it, remembers from day to day, makes decisions. Most importantly — <strong>it takes action.</strong> <span class="action">[Click.]</span> Important to note: we now have access to the same tools that the biggest companies in the world do.

  <div class="note-body">
    So let me show you how we're using AI as a teammate today in our caf&eacute;. At one level it's familiar: it answers when asked. <span class="action">[Click.]</span> Our food and beverage manager Rose jots down a recipe for silken carrot ginger soup and shares it with our caf&eacute; AI. <span class="action">[Click.]</span> The AI looks up the ingredients, sees their cost, searches the web for local market pricing, and updates the menu with the right price. <span class="action">[Click.]</span> <strong>This took 90 seconds.</strong>

    Last week it snowed. Finally. That same AI agent woke up before all of us and saw the weather. <span class="action">[Click.]</span> It projected that people enjoying the snow day by the park might want hot cocoa, and adjusted the menu to feature it. <span class="action">[Click.]</span> Then it drafted a social media promo and sent it to our very human social media person. All before 7am. <span class="action">[Click — time break.]</span> It's doing this kind of thing all day long. <span class="action">[Click.]</span> And annoyingly, it is very good at bugging me to get my receipts in so it can close the books. <span class="action">[Click.]</span> <strong>Books closed three days after month end.</strong> That used to take us two weeks.

    Yes, it is very active in helping run the business. <span class="action">[Click.]</span> We include it in our planning meetings — they all get immediately transcribed. It has pitch-perfect knowledge of our strategy. <span class="action">[Click.]</span> As a result it can see our blind spot — we don't have good data about how well we're converting foot traffic. <span class="action">[Click.]</span> So it orders a door sensor to help it see better. Very self-serving. But it allows it to guide us in running experiments to improve that conversion. <span class="action">[Click.]</span> Perhaps most annoyingly, it sees where <strong>I'm the bottleneck</strong> for getting things done, and suggests how it can take on those tasks.

    But here's the big one: <span class="action">[Click.]</span> it's improving itself every day, reviewing what it did. How well did its suggestions work? Did it take the hard way? <span class="action">[Click.]</span> Did its tips for better marketing work? <span class="action">[Click.]</span> But it doesn't just take notes — <strong>it takes action.</strong> <span class="action">[Click.]</span> Creating or editing its tools. Maybe planning for weather earlier. Maybe it needs to bug me earlier in the month about those Costco receipts to close the books on time. <span class="action">[Click.]</span> This is how AI accelerates the development of a new business in record time.
